Tensor computation is fundamental for many scientific and engineering applications, such as machine learning, data mining, quantum chemistry. Though dedicated hardware and software optimizations have progressed considerably for tensor computation, they primarily focus on either the hardware part or the software part. Optimizing the two parts in isolation inevitably suffers from sub-optimal solutions confined in a local design space. 

We start an agile co-design project for tensor computation —— HASCO. Efforts are made in optimizing the HW/SW interface, hardware architectures, software optimizations, and synthesis flow.

The source code is coming soon.
